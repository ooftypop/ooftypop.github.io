            How To Publish A Rails Plugin, In Four Easy Steps

            Rails is a pretty robust framework.
            I often find myself in awe at just how incredible it really is.
            But let's face it, sometimes you need something more.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Recently, I was thinking it would be terrific to log instances of my models to the console in a more readable format.
            I am finicky about code and content being easy to read, thus it was only natural that I extended that disposition.
            So I wrote a really cool module which I named "SnoopDogg".
            It alphabetizes the columns in my models and neatly prints them to the console, color coded by data type.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I was quite satisfied with my work and decided that it would be a terrific little snippet to share with the Rails community at large.
            So I turned it into a plugin which can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/ooftypop/snoop_dogg" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            This had me wondering how many cool modules and features have been created by developers and never shared, simply because they did not realize how easy it really is.
            So I decided to write this post to explain how to generate a simple Rails plugin, hoping that it will lead to some cool new gems for the community to use.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I outline the steps to generate, and publish the gem below (excluding testing).
            These steps assume you already have the latest version of Rails and Ruby installed.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I outline the steps to generate, and publish the gem below (excluding testing).
            These steps assume you already have the latest version of Rails and Ruby installed.
          </p>

          <h4>Step 1: Name your gem</h4>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Naming your gem is an important step because the community has naming conventions for ruby gems.
            Naming conventions give fellow developers a clue about what is under a gem's hood.
          </p>

          <div class="article-ul-wrapper">
            <h5 class="article-ul-title">In general, we try to follow these pretty simple rules:</h5>
            <ul class="article-ul">
              <li>Use underscore for multiple words</li>
              <li>Use dashes for extensions</li>
              <li>Don't use uppercase letters</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            If you want to read more about naming conventions, you can do so <a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/name-your-gem/" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            SnoopDogg was pretty simple. Camelcase modules and classes are converted into snake_case when naming a gem. Hence, SnoopDogg => snoop_dogg.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Be sure to double check that your gemâ€™s name has not already been taken before moving onto step 2.
          </p>

          <h4>Step 2: Generate The Repository</h4>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The step is probably the easiest. Use your shiny new name on Github or some other origin to create a repo.
            Then, in your local terminal, run "rails plugin new gem_name". In my case, "rails plugin new snoop_dogg".
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Poof! You have the scaffolding for a fancy new gem!
            It still has that new gem smell! Now initialize a local git repo, and push your initial commit to origin like you would do for any other project.
          </p>

          <h4>Step 3: Writing The Code</h4>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            This is where it can get tricky, depending on the complexity of the code you intend to share.
            We are going to look at a fairly simple case with SnoopDogg, but the general principles can be extended for more complex cases.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            In your gem's directory, you will find a file called "gem_name/lib/gem_name.rb".
            This is where you will place the code you intend to share.
            For SnoopDogg, this could have been simple enough, all I needed to do was paste my already written module.
            However, I wanted to go a step further and automatically include the SnoopDogg module in every model of an application downloading the gem.
            Here is simple way to do just that:
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Just under the module, in "snoop_dogg/lib/snoop_dogg.rb", I wrote:
          </p>

          <div class="article-code-block-wrapper">
            <code class="article-code-block">
              <span class="ruby-class">ActiveRecord::Base</span><span class="ruby-method">.send(</span><span class="ruby-key">:include</span><span class="ruby-method">,</span>
              <span class="ruby-class">SnoopDogg</span><span class="ruby-method">)</span>
            </code>
          </div>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Boom! Now SnoopDogg will automatically be included in every model in an application which uses it.
          </p>

          <h4>Step 4: Publish</h4>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Finally! Time to share our gem with the world.
            In "gem_name/gem_name.gemspec", specify some of the important information about your gem.
          </p>

          <div class="article-ul-wrapper">
            <h5 class="article-ul-title">Include:</h5>
            <ul class="article-ul">
              <li>The author(s)</li>
              <li>The homepage</li>
              <li>A contact email</li>
              <li>A brief description</li>
              <li>Any dependencies</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Now in "gem_name/lib/gem_name/version.rb" update the version number to reflect your work and then push your shiny new gem to origin.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            And that's it! You are done! It is as easy as 1, 2, 3, 4. (That is how that saying goes right?).
          </p>
