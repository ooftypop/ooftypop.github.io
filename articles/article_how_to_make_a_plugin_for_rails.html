            Rails is a pretty robust framework.
            I often find myself in awe at just how incredible it really is.
            But let's face it, sometimes you need something more.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Recently, I was thinking it would be terrific to log instances of my models to the console in a more readable format.
            I am finicky about code and content being easy to read, thus it was only natural that I extended that disposition.
            So I wrote a really cool module which I named "SnoopDogg".
            It alphabetizes the columns in my models and neatly prints them to the console, color coded by data type.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I was quite satisfied with my work and decided that it would be a terrific little snippet to share with the Rails community at large.
            So I turned it into a plugin which can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/ooftypop/snoop_dogg" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            This had me wondering how many cool modules and features have been created by developers and never shared, simply because they did not realize how easy it really is.
            So I decided to write this post to explain how to generate a simple Rails plugin, hoping that it will lead to some cool new gems for the community to use.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I outline the steps to generate, and publish the gem below (excluding testing).
            These steps assume you already have the latest version of Rails and Ruby installed.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            I outline the steps to generate, and publish the gem below (excluding testing).
            These steps assume you already have the latest version of Rails and Ruby installed.
          </p>

          <h4>Step 1: Name your gem</h4>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Naming your gem is an important step because the community has naming conventions for ruby gems.
            Naming conventions give fellow developers a clue about what is under a gem's hood.
          </p>

          <div class="article-ul-wrapper">
            <h5 class="article-ul-title">In general, we try to follow these pretty simple rules:</h5>
            <ul class="article-ul">
              <li>Use underscore for multiple words</li>
              <li>Use dashes for extensions</li>
              <li>Don't use uppercase letters</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            If you want to read more about naming conventions, you can do so <a href="https://guides.rubygems.org/name-your-gem/" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            SnoopDogg was pretty simple. Camelcase modules and classes are converted into snake_case when naming a gem. Hence, SnoopDogg => snoop_dogg.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Be sure to double check that your gem’s name has not already been taken before moving onto step 2.
          </p>

          <h4>Step 2: Generate The Repository</h4>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            The step is probably the easiest. Use your shiny new name on Github or some other origin to create a repo.
            Then, in your local terminal, run "rails plugin new gem_name". In my case, "rails plugin new snoop_dogg".
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Poof! You have the scaffolding for a fancy new gem!
            It still has that new gem smell! Now initialize a local git repo, and push your initial commit to origin like you would do for any other project.
          </p>

          <h4>Step 3: Writing The Code</h4>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            This is where it can get tricky, depending on the complexity of the code you intend to share.
            We are going to look at a fairly simple case with SnoopDogg, but the general principles can be extended for more complex cases.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            In your gem's directory, you will find a file called "gem_name/lib/gem_name.rb".
            This is where you will place the code you intend to share.
            For SnoopDogg, this could have been simple enough, all I needed to do was paste my already written module.
            However, I wanted to go a step further and automatically include the SnoopDogg module in every model of an application downloading the gem.
            Here is simple way to do just that:
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Just under the module, in "snoop_dogg/lib/snoop_dogg.rb", I wrote:
          </p>

          <div class="article-code-block-wrapper">
            <code class="article-code-block">
              <span class="ruby-class">ActiveRecord::Base</span><span class="ruby-method">.send(</span><span class="ruby-key">:include</span><span class="ruby-method">,</span>
              <span class="ruby-class">SnoopDogg</span><span class="ruby-method">)</span>
            </code>
          </div>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Boom! Now SnoopDogg will automatically be included in every model in an application which uses it.
          </p>

          <h4>Step 4: Documentation</h4>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Alas, we are done writing the code and ready to write the boring, yet very important documentation.
						This is where you will list your dependencies, make acknowledgments, define your licensing, and provide directions to use and even contribute to your gem.
          </p>
					<p class="article-paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            To start, we need to define the gem.
						In ‘gem_name/gem_name.gemspec’, you will find a short list of attributes which you can use to specify some of the most important information about your gem.
						Do not go crazy here, we will use the README.md to go into greater detail. Just be sure to include the following:
          </p>

          <div class="article-ul-wrapper" style="margin-left: 90px;">
            <ul class="article-ul">
              <li>The author(s) - This takes an array of strings</li>
              <li>The homepage - The repo url where the code is stored</li>
              <li>A contact email - Only put an email you are comfortable making public</li>
              <li>A brief description - Again do not go crazy, just something to the point</li>
              <li>Any dependencies - This is important because bundler will need this</li>
							<li>The licensing - SnoopDogg is using the MIT license</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Now let's take advantage of the README.md file so it can be referenced as documentation.
						Here, you will once again reference the authors, homepage, description, dependencies, and licensing.
						But the README.md is where you can (and should) go into greater detail.
						You can write a detailed description along with directions on how to install and use your gem.
						You can link to the pages of your authors, or the documentation of any dependencies.
						You can even provide information on how to contribute.
          </p>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            If you do not know how to write a README.md file, you can teach yourself <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/" target="_blank">here</a>.
						I would suggest taking the time to learn the syntax.
						It is quite easy to learn, and knowing it will allow your gem’s public repositories to display your README.md in a way that is pleasing to the eyes.
          </p>
					<p class="article-paragraph">
            Finally, visit ‘gem_name/lib/gem_name/version.rb’ to update the version number of your gem to reflect your work
          </p>

					<h4>Step 5: Publish</h4>
          <p class="article-paragraph">
            Now it is time to share our shiny new gem with the world.
						We will want to publish the gem on rubygems.org.
						This is where bundler commands will look when someone attempts to install your gem.
						To do this, you will need an account with <a href="https://rubygems.org/sign_up" target="_blank">rubygems.org</a>.
						If you do not have a rubygems.org account, make one now. I will wait here.
          </p>
					<p class="article-paragraph">
						Now that you have an account, you will need to ‘build’ the latest version your gem.
						From your gem’s directory, run ‘gem build gem_name.gemspec’.
						In my case, I ran ‘gem build snoop_dogg.gemspec’.
						A file will appear in your repository matching the naming convention ‘gem_name-version.gem’.
						My file was named ‘snoop_dogg-0.1.3.gem’.
					</p>
					<p class="article-paragraph">
            This file contains the information about this version of our gem. When we pass it along to rubygems.org they will pass that information along to anybody that downloads the gem.
						As the gem is updated and new versions are released, rubygems.org will make sure that any downloads are for the latest release, OR the version requested.
          </p>
					<p class="article-paragraph">
            From that same directory, run ‘gem push gem_name-version.gem’.
						You will be prompted to enter your rubygems.org credentials so that rubygems can give you credit for your contribution.
						Enter your username and password. Done!
          </p>
					<p class="article-paragraph">
            Yes, done! That's it! You are done! It is as easy as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. (That is how that saying goes right?).
          </p>
